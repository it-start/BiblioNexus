# 🗺️ Project Roadmap: The Path to "Synthetic Wisdom"

Our vision is to move from **Analysis** (reading text) to **Immersion** (experiencing truth).

## Phase 1: The Quantum Layer (Current Status: ✅)
- [x] **Structural Analysis:** Network Graphs, Distribution Charts.
- [x] **Temporal Analysis:** Timelines, Prophetic Arcs (Deep:3).
- [x] **Source Code:** Etymological Spectrometry (Hebrew/Greek).
- [x] **Peer Review:** Mistral Integration ("The Gardener").
- [x] **Multi-Persona:** The Council of Three.

## Phase 2: Harmonic Resonance (Next Step) 🎵
*Objective: Sonify the data to allow users to "hear" the emotional arc of Scripture.*

- [ ] **Sentiment-to-Audio Engine:** Map sentiment scores (Joy, Lament, Wrath) to musical scales (Major, Minor, Diminished).
- [ ] **Text Density Synthesizer:** Use the "Pattern Cluster" frequency to control rhythmic intensity.
- [ ] **Haptic Feedback:** Vibration patterns on mobile devices corresponding to "Divine Interventions" in the timeline.

## Phase 3: The Vector Nexus (RAG Integration) 📚
*Objective: Ground the AI in specific, authoritative theological texts rather than general training data.*

- [ ] **Vector Database:** Setup Pinecone or Milvus.
- [ ] **Ingestion Pipeline:** Index the *Church Fathers*, *Josephus*, *Dead Sea Scrolls*, and *Rabbinic Commentaries*.
- [ ] **Citation Anchoring:** The AI must cite *specific page numbers* from these texts, not just "general knowledge."

## Phase 4: Immersive 4D (VR/AR) 🕶️
*Objective: Walk through the data.*

- [ ] **Temple Reconstruction:** A WebGL/Three.js module to walk through Solomon's Temple based on the `ChronoSpatial` data.
- [ ] **AR Overlay:** Point camera at a Bible page to see the "Network Graph" floating above the text (OCR + Augmented Reality).

## Phase 5: Collaborative Theology 🤝
*Objective: Multiplayer Bible Study.*

- [ ] **Shared Sessions:** Websockets to allow multiple users to watch "The Council" debate live.
- [ ] **User Annotations:** Persist user notes into the Knowledge Graph, creating a "Community Commentary."
