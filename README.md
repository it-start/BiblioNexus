# BiblioNexus: Deep Bible Analyzer 🧬🌌

> "The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life." — *2 Corinthians 3:6*

**BiblioNexus** is not just a Bible search engine; it is a **Synthetic Wisdom Engine**. It applies rigorous systems engineering, biological metaphors, and multi-agent AI debate to reveal the hidden architecture of Scripture.

## 🔬 The Scientific Approach

We treat the Biblical Canon as a complex, living system. We analyze it using four distinct scientific lenses:

### 1. Etymological Spectrometry (Source Code) 💎
Just as a prism refracts white light into its constituent spectrum, our **Spectrometry Engine** refracts English theological concepts back into their original Hebrew (*Old Testament*) and Greek (*New Testament*) root words. This reveals the "semantic isotopes" that make up the full meaning of a word like "Love" or "Judgment."

### 2. Bio-Theological Sequencing (Scripture DNA) 🧬
We map theological attributes to a genetic metaphor:
*   **A (Adenine)** = Authority / The Father
*   **C (Cytosine)** = Compassion / The Son
*   **G (Guanine)** = Glory / The Spirit
*   **T (Thymine)** = Truth / The Word
*   **U (Uracil)** = Urgency / Action (RNA Translation)

This allows us to visualize verses as "protein strings" that perform specific spiritual functions (e.g., Redemption, Sanctification).

### 3. Chrono-Spatial Reconstruction (4D Maps) ⏳
Context is king. Our 4D engine reconstructs biblical locations (e.g., Jerusalem) across three distinct eras (Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman Era), visualizing how city boundaries ("membranes") and key structures ("organelles") evolved over time.

### 4. The Sanhedrin Protocol (Consensus Engine) 🏛️
Truth is established through debate. We utilize a **Multi-Agent System**:
1.  **Generator (Gemini 3 Pro):** Simulates a debate between an **Archaeologist**, a **Systematic Theologian**, and a **Mystic**.
2.  **Critic (Mistral Large):** Acts as the "Theological Gardener," performing a peer review to calculate a "Fidelity Score" and detect doctrinal entropy.
